# BulbToys/Core
This repository contains all the required files to create a BulbToys trainer, including [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook), [mINI](https://github.com/metayeti/mINI) and [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

### Disclaimer
This repository is currently an **early work-in-progress**, any and all information is subject to change without notice and may be missing or incorrect.

# Usage
### Requirements
BulbToys is an internal cheat designed as a DLL and it currently only supports DirectX 9 games.

This project does not include an injector, so you will need to use your own (eg. [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) or [Xenos](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos)) in case your game doesn't have an adequate DLL plugin loader.
